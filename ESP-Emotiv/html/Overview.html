	<h1>ESP-Emotiv - EEG Signal Processing for the Emotiv</h1>
	<h2>Release 1.3-SNAPSHOT, 27-04-14</h2>

	<p>
		This Java library provides the implementation of <a href="http://mrstampy.github.com/ESP/">ESP</a> library classes to acquire the
		EEG signal from the Emotiv. 
		ESP-Emotiv was compiled for Java version 1.6 compatibility. The core classes have been designed with speed and concurrency
		in mind using high performance Java libraries:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor">Disruptor</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://javolution.org/">Javolution</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache MINA</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Architecture</h2>

	<p>
		The <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/MultiConnectEmotivSocket.html">MultiConnectEmotivSocket</a>
		is the core class of this library.  Listeners can register themselves with the socket implementation and will receive the generated
		events as they occur, allowing near-realtime signal acquisition from the device. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But this doesn't explain the 'multi connection' name...
	</p>
	
	<h3>Remote Connection to the Multi Connection Emotiv Socket</h3>
	<img src="RemoteMCSUse.png" alt="Remote use of the Multi Connection Emotiv Socket" />
	<p>
		The Multi Connection Emotiv Socket allows connections from the
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/subscription/EmotivSocketConnector.html">EmotivSocketConnector</a>.
		Multi connection sockets can accept many such remote connections (theoretically thousands).
		The connections can be running in the same JVM or in different Java programs, even on different computers.  Due to the introduced
		latency resulting from the remote connection the signal received cannot be considered near-realtime, however the socket connector
		is quite useful for highly buffered signals and for applications such as data recorders. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Applications using the socket connector create the connection to the multi connection socket and subscribe to receive 
		device-specific events.  Listeners register themselves with the socket connector and receive the event notifications
		as they are received by the socket connector.
